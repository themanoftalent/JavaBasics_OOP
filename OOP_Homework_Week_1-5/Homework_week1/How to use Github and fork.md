-> Dear Adem <-

Here, I am explaining how to fork and push a Java assignment.

**Step-by-Step Guide with Code:**

1. **Fork the Assignment:**
   ```bash
   # Go to the assignment on GitHub and click the Fork button
   ```

2. **Bring it to Your Computer:**
   ```bash
   # Open your computer's command prompt/terminal
   # Clone the assignment to your computer
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. **Make Changes:**
   ```bash
   # Open and edit the assignment on your computer
   ```

4. **Save Your Changes:**
   ```bash
   # In the terminal, navigate to the assignment's directory
   # Add your changes
   git add .
   # Commit with a message
   git commit -m "Write a message about what you did"
   ```

5. **Send it Back Online:**
   ```bash
   # Push your changes back online
   git push
   ```

6. **Ask:**
   ```bash
   # Go to the assignment on GitHub
   # Click "New Pull Request"
   # Choose your fork as the source and the original assignment as the destination
   # Write a message explaining your changes
   # Click "Create Pull Request"
   ```
